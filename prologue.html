    <h2>
      <b>Aquar Volla</b>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Demon Lord</i>
    </h3>
      <p>
        Aquar Volla is one of the most dangerous criminal minds of the century. His continued existence on this planet is in spite of the fact that numerous government agencies as well as over 10 private armies have all performed attempts at his assassination, to no avail. He has a death warrant in over 80 countries and the United Nations has issued a "kill on sight" order to all of the police forces in the world. This utterly unholy abomination was born in the 68th pit of hell, his sole purpose being his mission to anally penetrate every single male in the world. <br><br>
        Upon arriving on Earth, however, he was restricted to an incredibly weak human form in contrast to his demonic presence back in hell. Thus, he was required by circumstance to dominate the world using only his supreme intellect, which has been measured as an IQ of 147 by a shitty online test. The collapse of the hell portal that facilitated his arrival completely obliterated his parents and house, a fact that Aquar consistently hides by refusing to give out his home address, though he has hypocritically exposed much personal information on others in the past, most notably SHS founder Sebastian Bach and the demigod Ryan Oldman. <br><br>
        Aquar has played numerous strategic battle simulators throughout his life, including CSGO, Valorant, and Valorant, to perfect his shooting abilities. During his time in high school, he built up an nearly unrivaled mafia presence, which he used to conquer multiple small countries and commit a significant genocide against the population for refusing to believe in his hellish origin. This put him on nearly every government watchlist on the planet.

      <h2>
        <b>Benji Noh</b>
        <h3>
          <i>Military Genius</i>
        </h3>
      </h2>
        <p>
          Benji Noh was once one of the best military commanders the United States had ever seen. His experience with video game war tactics in games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Valorant combined with his vast historical knowledge made him a prodigy in war strategy and defense. Benji Noh enrolled in West Point Military Academy with a specialization in Foreign Defense Threats. He passed valedictorian of his graduating class and worked his way through the ranks of the army, soon becoming a Lieutenant General. When WW3 broke out, Benji Noh successfully defended the United States and its free-world allies from the Eastern Alliance through an unconventional military strategy that Noh had developed himself. It was through these tactics that Noh showed his true talent and valor and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. <br><br>
  However, his bravery and military prowess would come at a price as he was honorably discharged with a Purple Heart after an raid on a rogue US military base in Syria. As Noh re-entered his civilian life, he chose to begin to do what he liked best: play video games. Noh lived off his high military pension, while continuing his gaming passion, getting better day-by-day. However, such a lifestyle would impact his health. His doctor made mention of his "unhealthy Flamin' Hot Cheeto consumption" as well as his "abnormally large and long feces". In addition, Noh had developed back complications because of his habit of sitting in his chair and playing video games. Soon, Noh was prescribed an acupuncture visit by his doctor.  <br><br>
  When he went to his appointment, he got mixed up and ended up at the original Seb's Gayeria in 2015. While Noh was not homosexual himself, he found the business model to be impressive. Noh then organized a meeting with founder Sebastian Bach and later became the company's first angel investor. Noh also began to cut down on his unhealthy habits, but isn't afraid to indulge in a snack here or there. Throughout his time with Seb's Gayeria, Benji Noh facilitated the franchising of Seb's Gayeria locations globally, growing Seb's Gayeria from a tiny startup, to a worldwide phenomenon.  Noh became the company's first chairman of the board of directors and used his military leadership background to help lead the company and advise Bach. In a 2017 interview, Bach mentioned that without Noh, Seb's Gayeria would be merely another statistic. Noh's life is something that is truly inspiring and should be an example to all of us of how we must get back up no matter what.

      <h2>
        <b>Bill Phan</b>
      </h2>
      <h3>
        <i>Tragic Hero</i>
      </h3>
        <p>
          At a young age, Bill Phan was consistently abused by his father, who forced him to both do yard work until his hands and knees bled and play piano for over 10 hours a day when not working in the yard or intensely studying for his elementary school classes. This caused him to eventually commit suicide, which resulted in him going to hell. In hell, Bill met the demon lord Aquar Volla, who took pity on Bill's life and believed that Bill did not deserve the fate of being condemned to hell. Aquar formed a malicious plan: he would use the purity of Bill's soul to take the lives of 300 others. The young Bill was given his life back in exchange for the souls of 300 atheists, but unknown to either of them, Aquar accidentally gave Bill mystical powers. When Bill was resurrected, his father had changed completely, realizing the damage he had caused. Bill's father became a better parent and more lenient, but still a little strict with Bill and eventually Bill flourished in school and piano and even took on a passion for swimming and video games. <br><br>
    In Bill's senior year, the mystical powers that Bill had received had become more apparent. At first it was small things. Bill would be able to nudge things with his mind. Bill found himself drawn to meditation and improving his focus, but he couldn’t understand why. Soon, by the end of his senior year, Bill had mastered his mystical capabilities and realized where they had come from. Bill now knew he had been used by Aquar all along. He began his quest to destroy Aquar and all that he stood for. Unfortunately, this was no small task, as Aquar had joined forces with Sebastian Bach of Seb’s Homosexual Services to form the most powerful mafia in the history of the world, which was led by distinguished military general Benji Noh and had control over at least 4 dimensions. <br><br>
    Bill's studies combined with his passion for video games began to pay off, as he now had the intellectual capability to devise a strategy to take down the unholy alliance. He realized that his only hope was to divide the interdimensional army and take them down with the help of Ryan Oldman, a local demigod with extremely powerful psionic abilities. Bill had Ryan put him in a pocket dimension where time passed one hundred million times faster than in his original universe, where Ryan and Bill meditated for two million years, building up their collective psychic powers. The quadratic scaling facilitated by their combined energies boosted their power levels to over 5 quadrillion. A week later, the vastly empowered Bill and Ryan emerged from the time chamber to wreak vengeance upon Aquar Volla. Aquar, however, was also stronger than ever. Through Seb's Gayeria’s Army, he had used the souls of every atheist in the four dimensions in order to boost his own powers. Additionally, the humanoid mafia paramilitary army of SHS would be a hindrance for Ryan and Bill. Bill instructed Ryan to go after Sebastian and Benji while he took on Aquar himself.

        <h2>
          <b>Rich T</b>
          <h3>
            <i>Anomaly</i>
          </h3>
        </h2>
          <p>
            Due to recent dimension-shaking events, strange fluctuations had begun to permeate the quantum foam, causing vibrations that induced questionable reality-bending phenomena in the fourth dimension. Entire galaxies were completely wiped from existence. Universes collided with each other, releasing enormous amounts of meta-energy into the void. Meanwhile, in another area of spacetime, on a planet known as Earth, a dog entered an alleyway and defecated on the ground.<br><br>
At this exact moment, the 56th dimension, also known as the Poop Dimension, happened to intersect perfectly with the first 4 dimensions. The potential energy of this alignment was blasted into the fabric of the universe, collapsing down to a single point in spacetime and creating the largest quantum disturbance to date. The result of this disturbance was the transmutation of the dog’s excrement into the being that became known as ゴゴゴRich Tゴゴゴ. T was found by the people walking the dog, who had just turned and begun to walk home. When they saw him, they ignored the glowing quantum aura around him and picked him up to raise him as their son. <br><br>
Rich T began his life as a normal child. He did well in school and had multiple friends who he could rely on. Rich T, unfortunately, had a problem: he had diarrhea. At first the diarrhea was manageable as long as Rich didn’t eat certain foods. His parents made sure to give him a healthy diet so that he would not have diarrhea. He got into a lot of fights as a child. This was not his intention, but he would rarely lose due to the escape tactic he discovered: using the quantum energy of poop in order to phase into the 56th dimension, also known as the Poop Dimension, where he is incorporeal and untouchable by anyone in any lower dimensions. <br><br>
Unfortunately, during his high school years, Rich T became severely addicted to poop. When T’s parents found out about his poop addiction, they immediately took him back to the alley that they found him in and threw him in a dumpster along with his creator and dog. He got caught in a downward spiral, becoming more and more addicted to poop. He committed multiple felonies in order to get his supply, the most notable being the raid and destruction of a dual bank/sewer treatment plant. This act was what got him on the radar of Sebastian Bach, who had a powerful organized crime force in the area and was looking for new recruits. When he saw how T had taken down the world’s most secure septic tank singlehandedly, he knew he was dealing with someone very powerful who could be extremely useful in the future. He immediately took in Rich T as a member of his mafia.

        <h2>
          <b>Ryan Oldman</b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <i>Demigod Simp</i>
        </h3>
          <p>
            Ryan Oldman was born from the union of a human and a god. Athena, goddess of battle and wisdom, got really drunk and slept with a homeless guy she found on the street that was tripping out on fentanyl. Unaware of her pregnancy, she headed back up to Olympus, when nine months later she accidentally fired Ryan to Earth as a powerful burst of mass-energy. Ryan struck the earth right next to a portal to hell created by the demon lord Aquar Vola, on his quest to anally violate the earth’s entire male population. This caused the portal to collapse, creating an explosion so large it obliterated the entirety of Australia and resonated throughout the fourth dimension, infusing the soul of Bill Phan with its immense power. Ryan would later meet Bill in person and gain his assistance in the fight against Aquar. <br><br>
            It was clear from an early age that Ryan had one of the best military minds in existence, with tactical abilities rivaling even those of the legendary US general Benji Noh. According to an online source, he had an IQ of 145, beyond that of Sebastian Bach and nearly as high as Aquar Vola. His divine heritage gave him extreme power which gave him an unmatched ability to predict enemy actions in combat and allowed him to use his psionic energy to move with extreme strength and accuracy. <br><br>
            In true demigod fashion, Ryan made a somewhat irrational decision to try and uphold the forces of good in the world. Obviously, he failed miserably at this. His first superhero move was to try and stop a woman from being mugged in an alley, where he unintentionally tore the mugger in half using his telekinesis. The woman who he had just saved fifty bucks immediately called the cops, and the cop car that happened to be right down the street apprehended Ryan and threw him in federal prison for twenty-five years. Halfway through his seventh year in prison, every guard in the prison was called out to control a massive fight that had broken out between two organized crime syndicates. Ryan saw this as a perfect opportunity to make his escape. He easily kicked out the bars on his window, jumped into an open dumpster in the alley where many believe that the legendary Rich T was born, and ran as far as he could. <br><br>
            Ryan decided to subdue his demigod powers in order to pursue a more normal career path. He
            thought that his demigod status was really a curse in disguise. Ryan became an accountant and worked his way up in 3 months to found Oldman Stacks and enter into a partnership with a new company that had recently sprung up during his time in jail, Seb’s Homosexual Services. With his disposable income, Ryan found himself donating to female Twitch streamers. He would pay good money to talk to them during the stream and without fail would say goodbye before the stream ended every time. Soon enough, he had wasted his time and had spent company money on female Twitch streamers and was eventually fired. He swore to get revenge on SHS.

            <b>Sebastian Bach</b>
            <h3>
              <i>Semi-Homosexual Criminal Mastermind</i>
            </h3>
          </h2>
            <p>
              Sebastian Bach was born to Tom and Victoria Bach. He had an older brother named Edward who was 7 years older than him. When Sebastian was young, he was a very active kid. He enjoyed Christmas caroling, camping with his family, and going to the beach. Additionally, Sebastian did very well at school and tested at a genius-level IQ of 143, enjoying classes like math and science. <br><br>
As Sebastian entered 7th grade, Sebastian's older brother Edward enlisted in the military and was deployed to a US military base in Syria. All of a sudden, everything changed. When Edward was away, Sebastian became sadder and depressed. He felt that he had lost one of his best friends and retreated into his room. His grades began to slip. He found peace in playing video games and sitting at his computer. As Sebastian entered high school, things were worse than ever. He had poor grades. On top of that, he realized he was 6% gay after meeting Mr Mo in his junior year, though those two events were unrelated. Before he graduated, Sebastian came out as semi-gay to his entire family. They immediately disowned him, throwing him onto the streets. For the next few months, Seb couch-surfed around while attending community college. In college, Seb found the strictly heterosexual agenda in Christianity to be toxic and began to worship Cthulhu. Surprisingly, this helped him focus and find his calling: to spread and normalize homosexual services all across the globe. <br><br>
Seb immediately dropped out of college and went to banks, asking for a small business loan. Unfortunately, most banks did not believe in his business model, often rejecting his loan application. Soon, Sebastian resorted to asking his friends for small loans. He used his intellect to convince them on the business model and using some money he scraped together, he started the first branch of Seb's Gayeria in a mall. At first, business was slow, but Sebastian came up with a marketing strategy that brought in some more customers. One fateful day, 5 months after the launch of the original Seb's Gayeria location, ex-military general Benji Noh walked in. Noh was intrigued by Seb's Gayeria’s business model and gave Sebastian a 500,000 dollar angel investment. With the loan money, Sebastian was able to repay his loans and start afresh. Seb, along with the guidance of Benji Noh, would spend the next 7 years growing Seb's Gayeria from a single location to a multi-billion dollar parent corporation known as Seb's Homosexual Services, with numerous subsidiaries, including Seb's Gay Resorts, Seb's Semen Park, and Seb's Own Dildos. He eventually gained enough political power to be appointed the new CEO of racism and built up his own private army rivaling that of the wanted man Aquar Vola. Sebastian shows that if we follow our passion, anything is possible. Sebastian created a new industry and then dominated it, even with all of the odds against him and remains a true inspiration to the homosexual community and the global community.
