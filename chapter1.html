    <h1> Chapter 1: The Taft Theory </h1>
    <i><h2>Benji Noh</h2></i>
    <br>
    <p>
      One summer afternoon, Benji Noh was visiting the grand opening of the sixty-sixth Seb’s Semen Park, a major milestone for the company. Benji was an early investor in the company and had stuck with it ever since it was a small store in a California mall.<br><br>
Seb, the founder of the global conglomerate Seb’s Homosexual Services in control of the Semen Park, was already there. <br><br>
Benji approached Seb and before he had the chance to greet him, Seb began to talk.<br><br>
“There’s something off about this place,” said Seb abruptly, his frantic eyes scanning around the outside of the park.<br><br>
“I don’t see anything,” replied Benji.<br><br>
“Yeah, me neither, but I feel something’s off. It looks fine, but I feel some kind of presence. A very heterosexual presence.” explained Seb.<br><br>
“Are you talking about me?” asked Benji.<br><br>
“No, Noh. Not you. Even more heterosexual. Something...” Seb paused to close his eyes. He concentrated, hands pressed against his temples. “...extraterrestrial!” Seb finally exclaimed.<br><br>
Benji was beginning to get annoyed. Ever since Seb had become the seventh richest man in the world, he had become more and more cryptic.<br><br>
	“What do you mean extraterrestrial?” Benji asked, visibly frustrated.<br><br>
	“I don’t know...But we need to cancel the opening,” Seb says, a frightened expression on his face.<br><br>
	“Seb, you know that I defended America in the War. You know that your brother even died for this country in order to give you a chance to make the world better! He fought hard to uphold capitalism and the free market and now you’re going to cancel an opening just because you have a stupid feeling?” Benji asked spontaneously. <br><br>
	“Look Benji, I know what my brother sacrificed and I know what you sacrificed, but this isn’t about that. Trust me, cancelling this is absolutely necessary.” Seb said calmly, though he looked very alert, as though someone were about to jump out at him at any moment.<br><br>
	“But what about all of the guests? They didn’t drive all of the way out here for nothing. This will hurt our public image!”<br><br>
	“You’re right. We’ll give them vouchers,” Seb said, quickly walking off to the guest center office of the park without giving Benji a chance to respond.<br><br>
	Benji decided he should head home. He walked out the employee exit, called a taxi, and sat down to rest on a bench outside the park, when he felt a cold shiver go down his back. He looked behind him, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>
What was that? Benji thought to himself. He could tell that something sinister was going on. Could this be the extraterrestrial bullshit Seb mentioned? <br><br>
Pondering what that was, he leaned back on the bench. A while later, he heard the sound of a car pulling up. Strange, the street had been empty a few seconds ago. He looked up. To his right, a white pedo van seemed to have just parked, as it was still idling. Then he noticed the man standing in front of him. <br><br>
Benji was face to face with none other than the demon lord Aquar Vola, standing before him in all his unholy glory. Benji was stunned by this appearance, unable to move for several seconds. Aquar stood still, staring directly into Benji’s soul. The air around him seemed to warp slightly as if it were extremely hot. Being wary ever since the war, Benji began to slowly reach for his gun, when Aquar finally spoke.<br><br>
“Greetings, mortal. I come to propose an alliance. As you must already know, I am the great Aquar Vola, lord of the 68th pit of hell, and leader of the most powerful military force in history. I know that you are a renowned and experienced general with a brilliant military mind. I offer you the ability to command unimaginable power at the head of my army. All I ask for in return are the souls of two people, whom I will specify.”<br><br>
Benji stared at him blankly.<br><br>
“What the fuck?” Benji eventually inquired.<br><br>
“It’s fairly simple. I’ll even cure your Flamin’ Hot Cheetah addiction while I’m at it.”<br><br>
“Hell yeah, I’m in.”<br><br>
“Good. Now, to business. Your first two targets are as follows: Sebastian Bach and Bill Phan. You know Seb, he’s the owner of this business, Seb’s Semen Park. He controls a very powerful mafia which could interfere with my future plans, and I need him eliminated. The other target, Bill Phan, is someone I think may have accidentally gained great power that he does not deserve and must also be taken out. You will have full access to the power of my own forces, which are yours to command for this assassination mission. I, meanwhile, have a different matter to attend to. There have been some strange quantum fluctuations in the area, and I think that ゴゴゴRich Tゴゴゴ may be involved in their origin. Also, if I stay longer, Seb may learn of my intentions, which could mess up the attempt. I’ll talk to you later.”<br><br>
“Alright, uh, see ya.”<br><br>
Aquar turned and walked towards the nearby pedo van. Benji watched as he opened the rear doors and climbed into the back of the van. Even through the heavily tinted windows, he could recognize a reddish glow emanating from the driver’s seat. As the van drove away, Benji realized that he still had no idea what to do. The idea of unimaginable power appealed to him, as well as being able to eat as many Flamin’ Hot Cheetahs as he wanted with no negative consequences. But as much as he currently resented Sebastian Bach for closing the park, he didn’t know if it was necessary to kill him. Still… Flamin’ Hot Cheetahs was a seriously good bargain. He decided that he would give it a shot, and if he didn’t succeed, well, no harm, no foul.<br><br>
Benji stood up from the bench and casually drew his signature gun, a heavily modified magnetic machine pistol. This gun had gotten him through many bad situations in the past. It had saved his life in the rogue military base in Syria, and it may help him even now. He clicked off the safety as he walked back towards the park entrance. Closed, just as he had expected. Not that this was an issue for him. Benji grasped the lock and easily ripped it off the gate, which swung open. Now to find his first target.<br><br>
The last thing Sebastian had said to him was that he was heading to the guest office. With luck, he would still be in the area. Benji began quickly walking toward the office building, hoping to complete his task before Seb fled the area. He thought through the plan in his head as he walked. First step would be to get past any security measures. As good as Seb was at covering up his illegal activities, it was likely that he had some sort of fallback plan in case the cops caught him. After getting past security, he figured he would simply take the shot and leave. There was no need to dispose of the body. Benji doubted that the police would come after him for killing a criminal such as this, even if he was an important political figure. All he needed to do was lay low until the evidence came up, then he would be in the clear.<br><br>
Benji tried the handle of the door to the office. Locked. No problem, he’d just use his left hand. After a loud crunching noise and the sound of metal scraping against metal, the door fell off its hinges entirely. So much for hiding the evidence. Benji stepped over the fallen door and began walking down the main hallway, looking for the Employees Only area, thinking that would be the best place to look. He almost missed the door to his left. This one was unlocked. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t really that helpful, though. The small room he looked into had only one exit, and it was blocked by a massive vault door. Benji had seen these doors before. Solid titanium. Any tampering resulted in a complete lockdown. Not exactly a door he could just rip out of the wall. If Sebastian was anywhere, though, he would be in the following room. Looks like he would have to do this the hard way.<br><br>
Benji raised his gun and set it to semi-automatic fire. He would have to fire 6 rounds in a near perfect hexagon in under three and a half seconds in order to hit specific points on the door, or the lock would collapse entirely and he would be stuck outside. Benji breathed deeply and let his mind go blank, focusing only on his targets. He pulled the trigger.<br><br>
One shot. A small section at the top left of the door had a hole punched through it by a small metal cylinder traveling at twenty thousand miles an hour. Sounds of moving machine parts came from the door. Benji had three seconds to hit the next five shots.<br><br>
Another shot. It hit exactly where he had intended. A repeated clicking sound began emanating from the door. Two and a half seconds left.<br><br>
A third shot. The clicking stopped, replaced by the sound of scraping metal.<br><br>
A fourth. The sound of gears grinding against each other. One second left.<br><br>
The penultimate shot tore through the bottom left of the door. The entire frame shifted. One last good hit and the door would open. If he missed, then it would all be for nothing. Benji pulled the trigger.<br><br>
Click.<br><br>
“Fuck.”<br><br>
He had forgotten to reload his gun.<br><br>
Then the door exploded.<br><br>
Benji dove behind the doorway to avoid the spray of shrapnel. After the smoke cleared, Benji looked back into the room to see a menacing shadow blocking his path, which was in the process of lowering the rocket launcher it was holding. Blue arcs of lightning crackled in the air around him. The figure lifted his hand, collecting a massive, pulsating ball of energy. This illuminated his face, which dripped with a strange brown liquid as he began to speak.<br><br>
“Breaking and entering… Destruction of property… and attempted assault with a deadly weapon. I don’t think anyone’s going to be very happy about that.”<br><br>
“Yo, chill, dude. I’m just trying to get through this door here. I, uh, locked myself out of my office, and I was trying to get back in.”<br><br>
“Bro, no one gets into their office while holding highly advanced military grade technology. You’re Benji Noh, ex-general of the US army. You’re here to assassinate your business partner, Sebastian Bach, most likely with the gun you’re holding right now. The problem is, I work with him too, and you’ll have to get through me first.”<br><br>
“How do you know all that?” Benji asked.<br><br>
“I see everything, Benji Noh. I eat poop.”<br><br>
“The fuck?”<br><br>
“Alright, listen, it was great talking to you but you have about eight seconds to leave this building before a lot of blood leaves your body.”<br><br>
“Nah, bro, I came here on a mission. I want my damn Flamin’ Hot Cheetahs. Get outta my way.”
“The last person that said something of that nature to Richard T… well, let’s just say that you’re going to have a really bad time.”<br><br>
“So be it.” Benji reloaded his gun and pointed it at Richard T. “Die, bitch.”<br><br>
Benji was fast, but T was faster. Benji unloaded an entire clip at his target, but T shot the bullets out of the air with powerful blasts of electricity, disintegrating them before they reached his body. Benji angrily reloaded and ran at T, diving over a ball of lightning, and swung a hard left hook right at T’s head. T ducked, but ran right into the following uppercut as Benji smashed the handle of his pistol into T’s jaw. Benji recoiled back in shock. T’s electric aura had run up his arm, causing him searing pain. T used this opportunity to jump into the air and deliver a powerful kick to Benji’s chest, flipping backward through the air and landing on his feet. Benji went flying backward and his head slammed into the floor as he landed, making a sizable dent in the ground.<br><br>
Dazed, Benji stood up and pointed his pistol at T, who was glowing even more than before, charging up his aura for one final attack. It was all or nothing. Benji ran at T, slamming his shoulder into T and knocking him over, screaming as the aura electrified his body. As T fell backward, Benji hit him with an overcharged uppercut with his left hand, sending him flying into the air. Benji fired every last bullet in his gun through T’s chest, the power of the shots suspending him in the air, until at last Benji ran out of bullets and T fell to the ground.<br><br>
“Dude, what the fuck,” said Richard, coughing up blood.<br><br>
“Hey, you started it,” replied Benji.<br><br>
“Nah, bro. Fuck this shit, I’m out.”<br><br>
With a small popping sound, Richard T. disappeared. He was there one second, and gone the next.<br><br>
At least that solved the problem of the door. And now he knew that there was something - or someone - worth hiding behind it. Benji reloaded his gun and stepped through the opening into the dark hallway that followed. He continued walking, alert in case any more hazards appeared. There was a surprising lack of doors in the hallway, though Benji couldn’t see the end due to the smoke and dim lighting. The hallway sloped slightly down, and he assumed that he must be underground at this point.<br><br>
After walking a significant distance down the hall, Benji thought he heard a woman’s voice talking. That was strange. There was no way a normal person could have gotten into the facility, since all of the guests had left when the park closed, and the majority of the guests were male anyway, which made this even less likely. Not to mention the fact that they had to get past the vault door and Rich T. Benji considered the other option - this was someone that Sebastian knew. There were rumors of him only being 6% gay, though most people didn’t believe this to be true. No, Benji was likely just imagining things.<br><br>
Finally, Benji reached the end of the hallway. A regular wooden door stood at the end, about twenty feet away from him. Good, at least it wouldn’t be a pain in the ass to open. Even less than usual, in fact, because it had just been opened by someone else. <br><br>
“Oh, fuck.”<br><br>
“Hey, Seb, how’s it going? Look, I’m sorry about this but I have to kill you now, because a literal demon told me to.”<br><br>
“Ah. I see. So Aquar’s trying to pull some more bullshit, huh? What did he offer you?”<br><br>
“Uh… I think it was unlimited power and the ability to eat Flamin’ Hot Cheetahs whenever I want with no health repercussions.<br><br>
“Not bad. Still, I think I’d rather not get shot by you. Give me a minute and I’ll go grab my rocket launcher and we can settle this like men.”<br><br>
“That sounds fair,” Benji replied. “But all’s fair in war. I of all people should know that. I just fought your bodyguard, Rich T, and I don’t have time for any more fucking around, so I’m just going to shoot you now.”<br><br>
“Wait, hold on a second-” Sebastian’s reply was cut off as Benji began shooting at him. To Benji’s surprise, none of the bullets landed. Or so he thought, until Sebastian opened his hand dropping a handful of bullets on the ground. <br><br>
“You aren’t the only one with a robot arm, friend.”<br><br>
“Yeah, I didn’t think about that,” Benji admitted. He contemplated this for a moment. Time to try out some of the gun’s “experimental” features. “However, I don’t think I ever demonstrated the function of this button on my gun. Let’s just say you won’t be standing up to any shots from this.” As he pressed the small green button, his gun began to vibrate intensely. A bright green glow emanated from the barrel.<br><br>
“Uh, I should probably get out of the way. Yeah.” Sebastian started slowly walking backward.
Benji fired a shot, which Sebastian moved incredibly quickly to avoid as it went flying past his head, leaving a trail of green light. It hit the wall behind him and exploded, making a two-foot wide hole in the wall. The room lit up as daylight spread through the hole. Guess that was a successful test.<br><br>
“Really? A fusion powered railgun. Not cool. Alright, I consider this self-defense.”<br><br>
In true anime fashion, Benji stood and waited as Sebastian powered up. The entire right side of Sebastian’s body became covered in a metal shell. His eye glowed red through the metal mask, and the area around them filled with a dim red light. He almost seemed to get taller. Finally, he spoke in a voice that sounded almost bored.<br><br>
“Alright, let’s get this over with.”<br><br>
Sebastian’s right hand began charging a glowing red sphere of energy. Benji was now mildly concerned for his own safety. He began backing up down the hallway, trying to find cover. Of course, there wasn’t any. His only hope would be to somehow get into the room Sebastian had just exited. Benji ran towards Sebastian, trying to get past him before he could finish charging his attack. He fired two more shots while running, which missed wildly because of his erratic movements. Benji had learned from his extensive military training that the best possible way to incapacitate an opponent is to kick them in the dick. So that’s exactly what he did, causing a predictable yell of pain.<br><br>
“Benji! What the fuck, man!”<br><br>
“Sorry, I had to do it,” Benji yelled back while still running straight for the door.<br><br>
By this time, Benji had run down the hall and entered the following room, which looked like some sort of laboratory. Strange machinery lined the walls. The most interesting thing was the large metal canister in the middle of the room, standing about 8 feet tall. Unfortunately, before Benji had time to look around more, Sebastian had finally recovered from his involuntary CBT and fired a laser at Benji’s feet. The force of the blast sent Benji flying forward, and he was about to run into the container when the front of it was blasted off by itself, hitting him right in the face. Benji fell backward and opened his eyes to view a large shotgun barrel pointed directly at his face.<br><br>
“And who the fuck are you?” asked the woman holding the weapon.<br><br>
“I was about to ask you the same thing. Hi, my name’s Benji Noh and I would appreciate it if you pointed that somewhere else.”<br><br>
“That’s fine with me.” She turned to Sebastian. “You can solve your own problems.” She then walked out of the room and down the hallway.<br><br>
“What the heck just happened?” asked Benji.<br><br>
“Nothing, really,” was the reply.<br><br>
“No seriously, can we talk about this?”<br><br>
“Yeah, as long as I’m allowed to punch you while doing so.”<br><br>
“Sounds fine by me.” Benji stood up to prepare for close combat. Sebastian sprinted at Benji, hand glowing with red light. Benji dodged to the side and punched Seb hard in the side of the head, knocking him to the floor.<br><br>
“So who was that really?” Benji asked.<br><br>
Sebastian jumped up and delivered a series of high-speed punches, most of which Benji was able to avoid. “Oh, her? She’s a project I’ve been working on recently.”<br><br>
“A project? The hell does that mean?” Benji delivered a bone-crushing left hook to Seb’s torso.<br><br>
“AI construct with a humanoid form. Gone wrong, gone sexual. Just like OurTube clickbait.”<br><br>
“You guys were totally banging, huh.”<br><br>
“I will neither confirm nor deny that statement.”<br><br>
“So, are the rumors true? You’re only 6 percent gay.” Benji ducked to avoid an energy blast.<br><br>
“Yeah, that’s correct. So why found a ‘homosexual services’ company? I just figured I could capitalize on the growing homosexual community. And it worked, didn’t it? I’m the seventh richest person in the world.”<br><br>
“With my help. I gave you half a million dollars.”<br><br>
“You did provide the start-up loan, but I could easily have done this myself. It just would have taken longer.” Sebastian hit Benji with a powerful right uppercut, lifting him into the air. Benji flipped backwards and landed on his feet.<br><br>
“Yeah, right. You wouldn’t be nearly as successful as you are now. You’d still be some random loser in the mall. You wouldn’t be shit without me.”<br><br>
“Well, you wouldn’t be shit without me either. You’re an ex-military general with PTSD and a fucking Flamin’ Hot Cheetah addiction. And you think that Aquar’s going to make you special. Well, Aquar can go fuck himself. You’re not fucking special. And I’ll prove it.”<br><br>
Sebastian raised his right hand and pointed it at Benji, who had now realized that it was equipped with a variety of weaponry, the most concerning weapon being the slot that had just fired a massive circular saw blade into his chest.<br><br>
Seb smiled. “I like this gun, it’s cool.”<br><br>
Benji coughed and spat blood onto the ground, pulling the blade out of his chest. “Funny, I was about to say the same thing.” He turned a knob on the side of his pistol and transferred it to his left hand. He hadn’t tried messing with the fusion rate before, but one way or another, he was going to find out what that would do. He pulled the trigger. The gun recoiled with a force that would have pulverized the bones of a normal human arm. The bullet left a beam of bright green light in its path. Benji flew backward into the wall behind him, which fortunately didn’t have any sharp objects attached to it, and created a dent in the wall on impact. That was much less damage than had been caused by the bullet, however, which promptly struck Sebastian’s right leg and pretty much blew the whole thing off. Blood and shrapnel filled the air as the bullet exploded. The result was a four foot wide crater in the ground and a 25% reduction in the number of Sebastian’s limbs.<br><br>
“FUCK! Now I have to fucking rebuild that, asshole. That’ll take me at least 2 hours.”<br><br>
Sebastian’s aura glowed a bright red as he lifted off the ground with a complete disregard for physics. He grabbed Benji and threw him bodily straight through the ceiling, following him out the resulting hole into the sky above the park before kicking him in the chest, knocking him back to Earth and about a foot into the concrete. He hovered far above Benji, both hands above his head charging a massive energy sphere. “I’m sick of this shit. Fuck this park, fuck gay people, fuck Aquar, fuck power levels, and FUCK YOU!”<br><br>
Benji responded in a clear and concise manner:
“Oh, shit.”<br><br>
The resulting explosion annihilated half the park and lit up the whole city with the power of ten suns for a fraction of a second. It shattered every glass window within half a mile of impact. No less than twenty people called the police. The police responded with the following formal statement: “Miss us with that anime shit, we’re not getting involved.”<br><br>
After a long time, Benji sat up, the debris covering his body falling to the ground. Sebastian stood in front of him, balancing on his remaining leg.<br><br>
“It’s a shame it had to come to this. I appreciate what you do, Benji. As much as I hate to admit it, SHS wouldn’t be as successful as it is today without your assistance.”<br><br>
“Thank you,” Benji wheezed. His face was covered in soot and his glasses were cracked and barely stayed on his face. “So, I assume you’re not going to kill me.”<br><br>
“I decided not to. You’ll be valuable in the fight against Aquar. And there’s a special project I’ve been working on recently that I think you’d be interested in.” Seb said. <br><br>
“Dude, I’m not helping you make your damn titanium dildos. You remember the backlash we got last time we tried one of your stupid projects.” Benny replied.<br><br>
“This isn’t going to be like last time. I don’t care what the community thinks about this. Aquar offered you limitless power, but he ain’t shit compared to this. Let’s just say I came across this interesting Wikipedia article on the Taft Theory, and I know what the next big thing is going to be.”<br><br>
“Are you sure? You know for a fact that this is going to be good.”<br><br>
“Yeah, I know what I’m doing. I think. But, honestly, it would be stupid to say no.”<br><br>
“Alright. I’m in.”<br><br>
TO BE CONTINUED...
