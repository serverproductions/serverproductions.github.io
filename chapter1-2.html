	<h2><i>Rich T</i></h2>
    <p>
Pain. A lot of pain. <br><br>
Richard T opened his eyes. He was back in his home - a dark alleyway, nowhere in particular. His dog was nowhere to be seen. A pool of reddish-brown liquid surrounded him, mostly his own blood. More red dripped from the massive hole in his chest, staining the concrete.<br><br>
“Gotta… get… that reggineration…”<br><br>
With his one functioning arm, he dragged himself across the ground toward his “charging station”, which consisted of an exposed outlet, his “charging fork”, which he kept nearby, and a cheap, cracked vital monitor he had found in the garbage. He fumbled around in the darkness for the fork.<br><br>
“There it is.”<br><br>
As he jammed the fork into the electrical outlet, a jolt of electricity surged through his body. He felt his lung beginning to reconstruct itself. His breathing restored, he began drawing on the energy of the 54th dimension. He reached for the button on his vital monitor. The cracked screen lit up, displaying a disheartening number.<br><br>
<tt>HP: 713 / 50828 (1.40%)</tt><br><br>
Richard sighed. “This ain’t it, chief.”<br><br>
He sat slumped against the wall for several minutes, one hand on the fork that continued to drain power from the outlet, the other on the monitor, the number slowly ticking up.<br><br>
<tt>HP: 821 / 50828 (1.62%)</tt><br><br>
“Fuck, dude. What was up with that guy? That gun is overpowered. And it looked like he got stronger when he absorbed electricity. I guess I have a bad matchup against him.” <br><br>
He laid back and closed his eyes to try to get some sleep.<br><hr><br>
<tt>HP: 5083 / 50828 (10.0%)</tt><br><br>
The vital monitor beeped, waking Richard from the edge of consciousness. The crescent moon was barely visible above, an hour higher in the sky. It dimly illuminated the alley with a red glow.<br><br>
A gust of wind blew down the alley. Richard quickly sat up. For a split second, a blur flashed across his vision, too fast for even his battle-trained eyes to track it. He adjusted his glasses, which had slipped while he was resting, grabbed his fishing rod from the crack behind the dumpster, and went to investigate. <br><br>
He walked down the alley to find a man standing at the end. He had his back turned, but a slight glow emanated from an object in his hands. Nothing else could be seen in the dim lighting.<br><br>
“What’s good?”<br><br>
The man jumped, surprised by the sudden noise. He turned around, hiding the object he was holding behind his back.<br><br>
“Oh, hey. I didn’t hear you walk over here.”<br><br>
“What’s that you’re holding?” T asked.<br><br>
“Something I found on the ground,” the man replied, holding up T’s vital monitor. It was making noise, so I picked it up to see what it was.”<br><br>
“That’s mine, you know. That’s, like, one of my four possessions. Can I have it back?”<br><br>
The man pressed his finger to the monitor’s sensor. The screen lit up, though it was too far away for T to read the number.<br><br>
<tt>HP: 90127 / 93298 (96.6%)</tt><br><br>
“It’s got these weird symbols on it, I don’t know what these are. You have any idea?”<br><br>
“Uhh… you mean numbers?”<br><br>
“Numbers… Interesting. I’ll have to look into these at some point.”<br><br>
“Seriously, dude. I don’t want people taking my stuff. Hand it over.” Rich T pulled out his rod as his body began emitting small blue sparks.<br><br>
“Woah, chill. You already look pretty beat up, I don’t think you’re up for a fight right now.”<br><br>
“Motherfucker. What’s your power level? Two? No way you could beat me.”<br><br>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You can have this back, though. I have no idea what it does.” T blinked and the man was standing in front of him, holding out the monitor. “Here you go.”<br><br>
“Okay, you’re kind of fast,” T said, taking the monitor. “I could probably still beat you, though.”<br><br>
“Maybe. We should fight sometime and find out. Name’s Benjamin, you can call me Ben though. Meet me in the alley across the street when you’ve recovered.” And he was gone.
</p>
<h2><i>Aquar</i></h2>
<p>
“What do you mean, he lost?”<br><br>
“I assume you saw the flash just now, sir.”<br><br>
“I did…”<br><br>
“Yeah, well, that was Sebastian. Apparently he is ‘on some anime shit.’ He kicked Benji’s ass.”<br><br>
“God damn it. Never should’ve trusted him with that mission. Is he still alive?”<br><br>
“Barely. He was below 10% for sure. I’m surprised he was able to withstand that attack at all.”<br><br>
“I should’ve known he was too weak. You think I should bother waiting for him to fight Bill, or should I deal with that on my own?”<br><br>
Aquar glanced over his shoulder at the driver. It did not respond.<br><br>
He sighed. “Well, if you want something done right, do it yourself. Turn the van around.”
</p>
<h2><i>Benji</i></h2>
<p>
All Benji had to do was escape from the remains of the semen park. Turns out, that was a much more formidable task than he had originally expected. Sebastian had fucked right off after his cryptic words about the Taft Theory, leaving Benji stranded in a crater filled with blood and various other bodily fluids. Unfortunately, Benji couldn’t completely disregard the laws of physics like Sebastian and just leave vertically, so he had to do it the hard way: climbing out through the rubble.<br><br>
Benji slowly stood up, sighed, and began limping toward the park exit.<br><br>
“Couldn’t have at least given me a lift… Really didn’t feel like doing this today. I could have just stayed at home and watched anime, but I came here instead. And I have to shower later, too. Damn.”<br><br>
The climb out of the crater was going to be difficult. The bottom was mostly flat, with occasional obstacles, but the sides were almost vertical and jagged where the concrete had broken. Benji looked around. The easiest path seemed to be a shallow canyon that led to a part of the wall that looked easily climbable. The problem was where the canyon passed through an underground section of the park that had partially collapsed. The path there was blocked by a large concrete boulder. Benji began walking through the canyon, hoping he would have enough strength left to clear his path. <br><br>
Five minutes later, Benji had managed to reach the blockage. He managed to push the boulder out of his way with the last of his strength, grunting with the effort. As he finished, he heard a noise coming from the ledge above him. Instinctively, he reached for his gun and fired at the source of the sound. The man that was standing there exploded in a flash of green that quickly turned red with his remains. Benji was already covered in too much of his own blood to care that more was raining down on him.<br><br>
“Fucking stalkers. Aquar probably knows I’m still alive, I guess.”<br><br>
The pain began to set in around ten minutes into the climb. A burning feeling set into Benji’s legs as the ground sloped more and more uphill. He soon became aware of a large shard of metal lodged in his thigh that he had somehow missed before. As he pulled it out, more blood running down his leg, he noticed its unusual weight - several pounds heavier than he had expected. Must have been from Sebastian’s leg, which was apparently made of the same alloy as Benji’s arm. He pocketed the shard, as that particular alloy was hard to come by and he might be able to use it to repair his arm later.<br><br>
Benji approached the wall of the crater. The ground sloped upward at a sixty degree angle, forcing him to grab onto the wall to continue his climb. Occasionally, a rock would turn out to be more unstable than it looked, and he would have to quickly adjust to avoid falling back down to the bottom. In his current state, a fall from that height would probably mean death.<br><br>
“Ehh, I’ve been in worse situations. Like when I lost my arm, for fuck’s sake. This is nothing. Though, if this sort of thing happens again, I’m gonna have to lay off the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.” He spat out a mouthful of blood. “Can’t get cured of that shit for this failure of an operation.”<br><br>
Benji’s hand grasped the top of the cliff. It had been eighteen minutes since the fight. He was no longer actively bleeding, but he felt slightly lightheaded from the blood he had already lost. <br><br>
“Fuck it, I’m speeding on the way home. Cops are gonna pull me over anyway, driving like I’m drunk, looking like this. And I just want to go to bed already.”<br><br>
He stumbled to his car. The windows had all been blown out by the shockwave from the blast. More things to fix. He opened the door and sat down, finally able to relax.<br><br>
“Alright. Time to do 85 in a 25.”
</p>
<h2><i>Aquar</i></h2>
<p>
The van shook with the sound of a sports car speeding past it at over a hundred miles an hour.<br><br>
“Please tell me that wasn’t Benji Noh passing us.”<br><br>
“That was not Benji Noh passing us. It must have been some other Asian guy with glasses who happened to have stolen Benji Noh’s car.”<br><br>
“Whatever. Leave him alone. He’s not worth going after at this point. Just drive back to the park.”<br><br>
The drive became bumpier as rubble from the blast began to appear more and more frequently. Through the tinted windows in the back of the van, Aquar could see smoke still rising from the park. He hoped that Sebastian was still in the park, as he would be much easier to find. Unfortunately, his recon operative had not responded for almost half an hour, so he didn’t really have an idea of what, if anything, was happening within the remains of the park. With all of the people that were supposed to do things for him, he really didn’t appreciate it when he had to do something himself. But seeing as everyone else around him seemed to be incredibly incompetent and unable to perform simple tasks, such as “Don’t be seen by the guy with the handheld railgun,” personal involvement would be necessary.<br><br>
The van eventually pulled up next to the park entrance. The iron gate at the front was mangled by the explosion, one of the doors having flown completely off its hinges. Aquar grabbed his trident from the van, pushed open the back door of the van, and flew out over the twisted mass of iron bars. He hovered low above the ground, scanning the rubble for any signs of life. What was left of the park was barely recognizable, and it would probably take a while to find Sebastian’s office in the mess.<br><br>
As Aquar flew over the center of the blast, he heard a voice coming from below:<br><br>
“God damn it, now he’s here.”<br><br>
Aquar immediately dodged back as a bright red plasma beam shot out of the ground, heating the air where he had been standing a millisecond earlier by several hundred thousand degrees. The flash of light blinded him momentarily, and he turned to avert his eyes. He looked up a moment later and found himself face to face with the man he had spent all his time looking for.<br><br>
Both of them stood their ground, hovering in front of each other in a standoff. Several exposed wires stuck out of the remains of Sebastian’s right leg, dripping blood to the ground below. Aquar noticed them and smiled. Sebastian returned an expression that was equal parts angry and bored. <br><br>
“Alright, what do you want?” he asked.<br><br>
“You see, I thought you were getting a little bit too powerful. Not strong enough to beat me in a fight on your own - I mean, even Benji Noh was able to do that to you, and he’s nowhere near my level.” Aquar indicated Sebastian’s leg. “But you happen to also have control over a quite significant mafia force, which possibly poses a threat to my operations. So I decided to eliminate you simply as a matter of good business practice. Now if you don’t mind…”<br><br>
“Bitch” was the reply. Then Aquar found himself a foot deep in the concrete.
</p>
<h2><i>Sebastian</i></h2>

CRITICAL HULL BREACH<br><br>
LOSS OF FUNCTION IN RIGHT LEG</tt><br><br>
“Getting kinda low… I should get back to fixing this thing.”<br><br>
In a mighty explosion, Aquar burst out of the ground, showering the area with rubble. Six rather demonic-looking wings projected from his back, each covered in multiple spikes that didn’t look like touching them would be very good for one’s health. His trident lengthened and expanded, glowing with purple energy and casting a dark shadow on the area.<br><br>
“Very funny, Seb. But I’ll have you know that this isn’t even my final form.”<br><br>
“Then I suppose I have to kill you before you finish powering up.”<br><br>
And with that, Aquar began to power up. Hundreds of purple plasma shards began to appear and accumulate around him, coalescing into spinning arcs of energy. Sebastian began charging an energy sphere of his own. Before he could strike first, Aquar’s energy blades hurled themselves at him. Many of them missed, but Sebastian was unable to dodge all of them as he focused on charging his own attack. One of the blades struck his left shoulder, leaving a deep gash as it passed through. Another bounced off the right side of his torso, dealing minimal damage. The third struck the energy sphere he was holding and dissipated harmlessly.<br><br>
“Well, that’s problematic,” said Aquar.<br><br>
Sebastian quickly dodged to the right as Aquar flew past him, swinging wildly with his trident. As he swung, his trident released several glowing afterimages of itself that flew off into the distance, exploding as they hit the ground. Unfortunately, turning to focus on this interesting effect left Sebastian unaware of Aquar’s wings, which scraped across the right side of his body, leaving scratches in the metal. Angered, Sebastian threw a punch at Aquar with his right hand, carrying his energy sphere with it. The sphere detonated, the resulting massive beam of red plasma launching Aquar into the air until he was obscured by the clouds. Unfortunately, it also knocked Sebastian out of his powered flight. <br><br>
“At least he’s gone.” Sebastian looked down at the rapidly approaching concrete. “This is gonna hurt.”<br><br>
Sebastian slammed into the ground, sparks flying as the remains of his leg scraped against the stone. He sat there in a pool of blood, his body covered in many small rocks. The silence was eventually broken by a muffled “Retard.” from above.<br><br>
“What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?”<br><br>
Sebastian climbed out of the hole to see Aquar gliding down to meet him. <br><br>
“This fight has been rather disappointing, Sebastian Bach. I expected more from someone of your reputation. Hopefully Bill Phan will put up some more resistance.”<br><br>
“Who the fuck is Bill Phan?”<br><br>
“That is none of your concern, considering that you will not be living long enough to find out.”<br><br>
“...prick. Fuck it, I’m powering up.”<br><br>
Sebastian’s internal reactor began to recharge, assimilating hydrogen from the environment to restart its fusion process. His body began emitting a bright red glow. Arcs of plasma emitted from his body, rising into the air on thermal updrafts. Aquar stood before him, resummoning his plasma blades, amused at this poor attempt at a last stand.<br><br>
Sebastian’s vital monitor beeped, alerting him that the recharging process was complete.<br><br>
<tt>HP: 119947 / 254124 (47.2%)<br><br>
AP: 1694 / 1694 (100.0%)</tt><br><br>
“That’s what I’m fucking talking about,” he said to himself, a decidedly creepy smile showing on the exposed side of his face.<br><br>
Aquar laughed. “What, is this supposed to be a concern? I’m simply more powerful than you are, even at your full strength. And your entire right leg is already gone. You can’t hope to beat me.”<br><br>
“The reason I lost my leg is due to me underestimating my opponent, who happened to be carrying a fusion-powered railgun,” Sebastian explained. “Now, I happen to be armed with a few rather similar weapons myself. And all you’ve got is that glorified fork. So try not to talk too much shit.”<br><br>
Aquar blinked and Sebastian was already gone. At the same time, he felt an incredible amount of pain. He looked down to see a metal arm protruding from a massive hole in his chest. His plasma blades faded out from a lack of concentration.<br><br>
“I suppose I should say ‘no homo’, since I’m fisting a guy.”<br><br>
Aquar swung his elbow back, hitting Sebastian in the side of the head and knocking him away. He quickly turned around, swinging his trident as he did so. Sebastian dodged the resulting afterimages.<br><br>
“Consider yourself underestimated,” Aquar said, clutching his chest with his free hand. He dashed toward Sebastian, stabbing him in the right arm with his trident. The afterimages tore through Sebastian’s arm, spraying blood and shards of metal. <br><br>
“Can you guys stop breaking my armor? This thing was a pain in the ass to make.”<br><br>
“No.”<br><br>
“Fair enough.”<br><br>
Sebastian threw a right hook, which connected with Aquar’s jaw. A searing pain shot through his injured arm as he did so. To his surprise, his blade launcher fired right into the side of Aquar’s head.<br><br>
“At least this thing still works. Nice.”<br><br>
Aquar ripped the saw blade out of his face and tossed it aside, resummoning his plasma blades as he did so. Thousands of spinning purple shards collected around him.<br><br>
“Like I said, I’m more powerful than you are. Let me give you an example.”<br><br>
Every single one of the blades launched itself in Sebastian’s general direction. He quickly generated an energy field to block as many as possible, seeing how that had worked well against this attack in the past. His arm flashed back and forth hundreds of times a second, blocking as many of the projectiles as possible. Even so, a few of them managed to strike his remaining leg, and the effort of moving with such speed put enormous strain on the biological components of his injured arm. Not to mention how concentrating on this onslaught made him oblivious to the fact that Aquar had flown around behind him.<br><br>
A powerful kick to the back of the skull knocked Sebastian face-first into the concrete. He began to stand up, only to feel Aquar’s trident stabbing him in the back, the afterimages passing through his chest and rearranging his organs. Aquar lifted Sebastian’s body with his trident, striking it with several hundred punches in a fraction of a second, and swung his trident back towards the ground, slamming Sebastian into it with extreme force.<br><br>
“Fuck,” was Sebastian’s enlightening response to this sequence of events.<br><br>
<tt>HP: 61752 / 254124 (24.3%)<br><br>
AP: 1914 / 1694 (113.0%)<br><br>
CRITICAL HULL BREACH x2<br><br>
LOSS OF FUNCTION IN RIGHT ARM<br><br>
REACTOR TEMPERATURE DANGEROUSLY HIGH</tt><br><br>
“Wait a fuckin’ minute…”<br><br>
As the blasts from Aquar’s trident passed through Sebastian’s reactor core, they seemed to have overcharged it. Normally, this would be a very dangerous occurrence. However, it happened to be less dangerous than losing the fight to Aquar, so he was okay with it for the time being.<br><br>
Sebastian’s face, buried in the rubble, was equal parts grimace and evil grin.<br><br>
“Alright, let’s get this over with.”<br><br>
He flipped backward through the air, taking several dozen plasma blades to the back in the process, and landed on top of Aquar, kicking him into the ground so hard that he bounced off of it back into the air. Aquar was surprised by this sudden burst of energy.<br><br>
“Thanks for the boost. I’d like to check out that trident once we’re done here.”<br><br>
Sebastian spun around, using the momentum to deliver a crushing uppercut to Aquar’s already airborne body and knocking it higher into the air. His right arm fired an energy beam that knocked Aquar even further upward, burning off a significant amount of the skin on his face. Sebastian flew high into the air, ready to deliver the fatal blow. He looked down at Aquar, who, to his surprise, was charging up one last attack of his own. Aquar’s exposed flesh glowed with a hellish orange light, flames igniting on his wingtips. A massive fireball hovered above his left hand. <br><br>
“That’s a Hellfire Blast, isn’t it? We’re really gonna settle this with a beam struggle.”<br><br>
“Fuck anime.”<br><br>
Aquar fired a burst of extreme heat, burning the air itself as it traveled upward. Sebastian’s core glowed with a blinding red light as he charged up his own final attack. A powerful arc of red plasma ejected from his hands. Both blasts struck each other and exploded, lighting the already shaken city with the power of a hundred suns.<br><hr><br>
Bill Phan looked out of his window to see the beam of light streaking across the sky. He felt that the phenomenon was somehow familiar to him, igniting a faded memory from his troubled past.<br><br>
Far outside the city, Ryan Oldman sensed the energy signature of the explosion. He looked to the north to view an orange glow, partially obscured by cloud cover. He knew that the city to the north was the location of an important SHS building. At the same time, he felt the presence of an energy he had not felt since infancy - the power belonging to the demon lord Aquar Vola. Ryan turned off his computer without even bothering to say goodbye to the female Twitch streamer he was watching. He picked up his spear and opened his front door for the first time in months. He knew what to do.<br><hr><br>
<tt>HP: 3204 / 254124 (1.26%)<br><br>
AP: 0 / 1694 (0.00%)<br><br>
HEALTH DANGEROUSLY LOW<br><br>
AURA DANGEROUSLY LOW<br><br>
TARGET ELIMINATED</tt><br><br>
The collapse of the blast vacuum pulled Sebastian and Aquar’s inert forms toward each other as they fell to the ground, their energy completely spent. The bodies struck the ground at the same time. The two of them lay there in the molten remnants of the totally annihilated park, unable to stand.<br><br>
“That was not very productive,” Aquar stated.<br><br>
“Agreed.”<br><br>
They sat in silence for several minutes before Sebastian spoke again.<br><br>
“Let’s face it, Aquar. We’re both too stubborn to die. Fighting each other is a waste of time.”<br><br>
“Yeah, that’s true.”<br><br>
“In the future, I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me. Our goals aren’t in conflict.”<br><br>
“Have you considered working together? We would be basically unstoppable if we were to join forces.”<br><br>
“We would, yeah. I’m down.”<br><br>
“It’s settled, then. We will combine our armies to create the ultimate mafia. That should make it easier for both of us to achieve our goals.”<br><br>
“Alright, then. Step one is getting the fuck out of this place.”
<br><br>
With a few sparks, Sebastian’s core began glowing again. His flight power was gradually restored. He lifted off the ground and began slowly floating in the general direction of the hospital, trailing blood as he went. He looked back to see Aquar spread his wings and lift off into the night.
